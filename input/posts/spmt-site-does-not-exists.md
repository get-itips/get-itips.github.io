Hello,

Doing some tests migrations from SharePoint Server (on-premises) to SharePoint Online using SPMT ([SharePoint Migration Tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepointmigration/new-and-improved-features-in-the-sharepoint-migration-tool)) using the SPMT PowerShell module I faced this error message:

```
Task did NOT pass the parameter validation, the error message is The target site does not exist
```

At first, I checked if, maybe I mispelled the target SPO site, but it was ok, reading the logs I found this

```
Microsoft.SharePoint.Migration.Common.Exceptions.WebTransportException ---> System.Net.WebException: The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a send. ---> System.IO.IOException: Unable to read data from the transport connection: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host. ---> System.Net.Sockets.SocketException: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host

```

Hmm... SSL... This must be related to TLS 1.2 in PowerShell, to check, tried to use ```Invoke-WebRequest``` against an SSL site and it failed with

```
Invoke-WebRequest : The request was aborted: Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel.
```

So I run in PowerShell:

```
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
```

And voil√°, the error was gone and the migration finished with no issues. Keep in mind, that command will only last for the duration of the PowerShell session.

To make it permanent I ran this one-liners:

```
Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\.NetFramework\v4.0.30319' -Name 'SchUseStrongCrypto' -Value '1' -Type DWord
Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NetFramework\v4.0.30319' -Name 'SchUseStrongCrypto' -Value '1' -Type DWord
```

Hope this is useful for someone as it was for me.
