internal
external
or one endpoint is internal and the other is federated or remote...

any situation will do.

This was happening to me on an On-Premise deployment of Skype For Business (Front end and Edge Server) calling to Unified Messaging contact on Exchange Online.

ICE Candidate negotiation was happening but eventually no remote-candidates were negotiated.

ms-client-diagnostics: 22; reason="Call failed to establish due to a media connectivity failure when both endpoints are internal";UserType="Callee";MediaType="audio";MediaChanBlob="NetworkErr=no error,ErrTime=0,RTPSeq=0,SeqDelta=0,RTPTime=0,RTCPTime=0,TransptRecvErr=0x0,RecvErrTime=0,TransptSendErr=0x0,SendErrTime=0,InterfacesStall=0x0,InterfacesConnCheck=0x0,MediaTimeout=0,RtcpByeSent=0,RtcpByeRcvd=0,BlobVer=1";

So this must be firewall-related, this is almost always firewall-related, it seems first that the NAT was maybe responding with another external IP from de ISP Pool, but that was ok, the rules were correct, we checked and re-rechecked, and after so many hours of troubleshooting with Snooper and Wireshark, we started to look more deeply on the firewall and tried weird things.

The firewall, a Fortigate one, had a NAT button enabled on the rule, you would say, that is obvious that must be activated... but we tried and deactivated that and... Voil√°! we saw the face of god at that moment, it worked, the remote-candidates were negotiated at that moment  (so always be sure that this line is present if you want to know that it is working ok)

a=remote-candidates:1 65.55.127.80 54860 2 65.55.127.80 54721

and we lived happily ever after.
