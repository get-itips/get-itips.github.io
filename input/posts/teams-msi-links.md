If you use the Microsoft Teams msi version and are looking for a past version for any reason, you can use this method, "hacking" into the following url, replace the required strings and get the desired version of the msi

## For 32-bit version

```
https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/production-windows/VERSION/Teams_windows.msi
```

_For example_
```
https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/production-windows/1.3.00.4461/Teams_windows.msi
```

## For 64-bit version

```
https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/production-windows-x64/VERSION/Teams_windows_x64.msi
```

_For example_
```
https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/production-windows-x64/1.3.00.4461/Teams_windows_x64.msi
```

Hope this is useful for anyone.
